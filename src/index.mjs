/**
 * skill-family-harness-node: the default Node mechanism runtime for Skill
 * Family engineering contracts.
 *
 * The harness is a thin runtime: it consumes skill-family-contracts (envelopes,
 * schemas, dialect routing, kernel protocol, stable error codes, fixtures)
 * and implements mechanism only — validator caching, contained filesystem
 * access, atomic writes, temporary workspaces, resource closure, and the
 * operation-request -> operation-result pipeline. It owns no business
 * semantics, no orchestration, no git, no network, and no second language.
